# Trashspotting - Reducing Public Litter with Data Science

## Image Recognition Model with Object Detection

### Problem Statement

Public litter has large environmental, sustinability and livability impcts in many U.S. communities. As a result, this project seeks to help address the issue with data science.

### Introduction

Image recognition project using Google [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) and [Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). This notebook is based on the example provided by this [tutorial](https://link.medium.com/uTgS5pRCPS) on Medium.

### Image Analysis

This project implements an image recognition model with object detection using TensorFlow. It includes the necessary Jupyter notebooks, Python files and datasets to deploy the model.

### Object Detection API

Image analysis was improved with the Object Detection API; specifically, annotated images were used to train a custom model. The trained model was used to evaluate test images.

### Installation

Clone Github repository, then run locally or with Colaboratory. Local installation will require TensorFlow and all dependencies.
