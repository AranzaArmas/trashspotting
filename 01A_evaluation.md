# Trashspotting - Trained Model Evaluation

## Collection of Tutorials and References to Evaluate Image Recognition Models

### Purpose

Evaluate image recognition models to develop custom model for litter detection in California.

### Problem Statement

Public litter has large environmental, sustainability and livability impacts in California. As a result, this project seeks to help address the issue with data science.

### Introduction

Image recognition project using Google [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) and [Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).

Each major tutorial is organized into its own notebook module and cited accordingly.

### Image Analysis

This project seeks to implement a custom image recognition model with object detection using TensorFlow. It includes the necessary Jupyter notebooks, Python files and datasets to deploy the model.

### Initial Results

Results are shared in this [Colaboratory Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eIptxz6tX-b5ISX_bTRW9PlHvf7AQYID) and were developed using a Google TensorFlow template for object detection. It uses the R-CNN/Inception ResNet algorithm to analyze publicly available photos and Google Street View imagery with object detection.

### Installation

Clone Github repository, then run locally or with Google Colaboratory. Local installation will require TensorFlow and all dependencies.
